Dear Establishment,

I now understand that I should not complain about trivial matters to the public (and that all my personal matters are trivial compared to apes of more established residence and Community membership). I will do my best to avoid inconveniencing them at all times (for now on). 

I understand that it is a (government-endowed) privilege to work for a liveable income (and that not all people are legally entitled to such). That's okay! Might makes right (which means that those most adapted to performing some Establishment-valued job or economic benefit receiving situation will be given such while not necessarily all people are). They will just have to "make do" with shorter lives and diminished quality of life compared to the more Establishment-aligned peoples. May the Establishment's priorities and actions align with your survival and thrival goals. Amen.

(It is important to note that fresh blood is more urgently and long-term needed than is prolonging the lifespans and healthy living conditions for single child-free adults (even if environmental and infrastructural conditions are taxed beyond their current capacity to enable every human within that space-time allocation to live for as long as they each individually want to and in conditions which are not intrinsically detrimental to any respective individual's health). Hence, it may be necessary to (a) kill, quarantine, or intensely micromanage those who are above a certain age and/or who do not prioritize increasing the human birth rate at all costs their number one priority and/or (b) forcibly impregnate female-bodied humans who are deemed to be sufficiently fertile and most convenient to coerce into carrying (and likely raising) at least one biological (or in vitro fertilization implanted zygote from some other female-bodied human's eggs). That way, there will be pliable young minds, nimble fingers, vibrant energy, and sexually attractive bodies (equipped with brains, of course) to do the Work of sustaining human civilization for centuries. The old simply cannot keep up and should not siphon resources away from the young who need them most in order to do so. You are not entitled to live here for free. Make yourself useful in the Establishment's eyes or be pressured into obsolescence, incapacitation, relinquishment of rights, and maybe even an earlier death than you wanted).

Love (it's all about Love (yuck)),
