The air purifier which I bought last month and have had since running at full blast in my room at my current legal residence has an indicator light on it which changes colors according to the amount of air pollution it detects (and I have left the room's window fully open while the curtains are drawn permanently closed). I have seen that indicator light spontaneously change from "excellent" to "fair" (which lead me to conclude that a significant amount of second-hand or third-hand is present in that room and that some of the third-hand cigarette smoke residue on the walls which accumulated during the years the house was inhabited by multiple heavy smokers who smoked indoors (and those people were my now deceased paternal grandmother and my father who was living with her after my parents decided to reside at separate houses due to some kind of conflict). I remember reading a news article published via Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory approximately one decade ago about how third-hand cigarette smoke is a hidden health hazard which is about as dangerous as second-hand smoke (yet harder for the naked human senses to detect). To get around that issue, I decided to move my setup to the backyard immediately outside of that bedroom so that I can fish power cords through the small hole I made in the screen approximately one year ago to power my electronics (and I plan to use the tent which is packed away in my closet if it rains). 

So far, my solution seems to be working for me (and the other two human residents of the house I legally live at: my dad and my dad's friend Steve). There seems to be a nice Feng Shui going on within the bounds of what is considered to be the property which is my legal residence since I made the move to the backyard (which is one of the most comfortable and inspiring setups I have been able to semi-long-term obtain especially beneath a starry night sky). What is not going so well (according to me) is how at least one of the households bordering the lot which is next to "my spot" in the backyard consistently seems to be waging some kind of war against me (even as I write this note). 

Right now, they using loud leaf blower machines and have been using them for the past hour as soon as I started doing some relaxation exercises (and I think those neighbors are deliberately trying to sabotage my backyard living situation so that it discontinues and I go back into relative hiding and squalor while only "the chosen ones" get to dominate the outdoors (and they have a way of revving the motor rather than letting it run for longer than three seconds seemingly in order to prevent me from drowning out the sound)). What those people typically do (seemingly any time they suspect I am at my house and not "put away" in bed with my eyes closed, computer off, and body idle past 11PM) is turn on an obnoxiously bright floodlight in their backyard which used to illuminate the walls of my room (before I put up a tarp on the interior side of the curtains to increase the opacity of those curtains) and leave that light on for 5 to 25 minutes and sometimes they flash me more than once per night. I think those people have a vendetta against me being allowed to control my own circadian rhythm and lifestyle (which means I consider those people to be my enemies and part of an informal and loosely defined category of humans I refer to as XYZ and who seem to mostly comply with The Establishment's evil doings). 

XYZ are people who come across to me as overtly lacking in professionalism, esteem worthy qualities (because they seem to do little more than look after their household while being too selfish and unempathic to avoid causing people outside their circle pf concern distress), and exhibiting what seems like obnoxiously attention seeking and controlling behavior.

I often lament that the world I live in is parasitically infested with XYZ and that XYZ seems to be The Establishment's most favored and catered to people. XYZ do succeed in causing me significant inconvenience and discomfort (so they can pat themselves on the back for a job well done). I am not petty enough to retaliate (because, if I did, I might become just another XYZ person (and what I think is an essential part of what makes karbytes great is not being just another XYZ person and, instead, someone who genuinely practices "live and let live" (instead of trying to police other people or meddle in their affairs without being explicitly invited by them to so so) and who embodies a deep commitment to ecological sustainability, animal welfare (especially via the practice of veganism), and ongoing intellectual and spiritual growth (through studying various academic subjects, doing first-hand research and development projects, and engaging in consciousness expanding practices in a sensible way).

I may sound self-righteous to some people (especially to XYZ), but if I did not live by my consciously chosen ethical values and, instead, let XYZ dictate my worldview (in terms of ethics and ontology), I doubt I would be nearly as happy and healthy as I currently am. I thought I heard an XYZ woman bark at me for being too hoity toity (but perhaps and hopefully I misheard her while she was saying something totally not intentionally directed at me).

Lastly, I do have fairly decent noise blocking technologies such as noise reduction ear muffs, ear plugs, (cheap) over-ear headphones, and sound generator software applications and hardware to play those sound generators either through my headphones or through the device speakers.
