Without going into the visceral details of my day today, I will state that I became cognizant of something which I think is interesting and recurrent as a pattern throughout nature (and particularly in contexts where mutually-corresponding abstract and physical constructs emerge and form one complete instance of (computationally-generated) qualia):

the idea that every discrete and constituent component of some whole software object, C, is accounted for by its encompassing virtual reality, B, inside of a space-time continuum which is modeled by and represented directly as that virtual environment (and the idea that such a virtual universe could possibly interact with its "lower-level" processes occurring inside of the (relatively physical) harware, A, which runs that virtual universe in a manner which is logical and such that the respective software object, C, could interact with its "physical environment", A, indirectly by interacting with its encompassing "virtual environment", B).

If C is able to interact with B in a logically consistent manner (and C is an entirely-virtual information processing agent (with respect to A)) and if B is able to interact with A in a logically consistent manner, then C can interact in a logically consistent manner with A and, thereby, transcend levels of virtualization (which to me seems like one entity interacting with two seperate yet interacting universes simultaneously or else one of those universes at a time (but the only universe which C seems able to interact by itself is B while C has to interact with B first in order to then interact with A each time C tries to make an update to A)).
