I was just thinking about something that was taking me days to write down. Here it is: your only real job is to enjoy the space-time you occupy (because to do otherwise (i.e. to be miserable) is to cause yourself and others to suffer more than they could otherwise (and by my and their ethics, ought)).

In order to have a mind, that mind needs a definite allocation of space-time and matter-energy in which and by which to live and to carry out its processes as an information processing (and decision-making) agent (and a machine which may or may not have a mind which is self-aware).

People might be mad at me until near the end of next year. People might be mad at me for longer than that. People might be mad at me for shorter than that. 

I love logic. At the end of the day, I am merely a philosopher and my ultimate tool is logic itself. Using logic, I can turn nothing into something and something into nothing. I can make phenomena appear and disappear. I can shape reality to some extent, but logic is just as relevant "outside" of my mind as it is in the "regions" of reality which are not encompassed by my mind.

I also wanted to say that I feel like I work best as imagining that I am simultaneously three people interacting with each other in a collaborative (or conflicting) manner. Two of me I name karbytes_0 and karbytes_1 simply represent distinct and non-overlapping subjective points of view about aspects of my own mind (including what my mind constructs as being outside of my mind). One of me is simply named karbytes and is more of a neutral facilitator of communication between karbytes_0 and karbytes_1 (but at times karbytes cannot help but "materialize" as a character which interjects its own words into a conversation being had between karbytes_0 and karbytes_1).

karbytes_0: "People supposedly spend a third of their lives sleeping. That seems like a lot of wasted time."

karbytes_1: "Some people think that sleeping is literally the best part of their lives and the part they most enjoy."

karbytes_0: "Such people sound like literal prisoners who do not enjoy their lives and would rather be dead but do not have the means to end their lives as cleanly and perhaps as painlessly as they wish. Perhaps sleep (especially while dreaming) is the only opportunity they get to have any sense of not being in intense agony and maybe even have some fun."

karbytes_1: "Such people sound like they would not have very rich inner worlds if they were forced to remain so long-term intellectually and physically stagnant."

karbytes_0: "Are you suggesting such people are better off dead?"

karbytes_1: "Not necessarily. They could be useful as slaves and maybe also as specimens for scientific research. Hence, maintaining their capacity for subjective experience may be useful to The Establishment (and, in order to keep those slaves from being too burdensome to it (for reasons priorly discussed in this journal entry), The Establishment ought to not deliberately cause any of its prisoners, slaves, invalids, or any other (legal or non legal) inhabitting persons to suffer any more than necessary for the sufferer's own benefit)."

karbytes: "This almost looks like a piece of legislation in the making."
