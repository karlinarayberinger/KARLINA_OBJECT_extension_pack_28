The following provides an overview of karbytes' basic ethical parameters and could be described as a sequel to the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_ontology/

1. SECULAR_HUMANISM: the classification of all humans (and every other instance of "Sufficiently Sentient Information Processing Agent") as being unconditionally, individually, and equally worthy of SUFFERING_MINIMIZATION.

2. TRANSHUMANISM: extending human lifespans and human capabilities through technological means (especially means which include melding a human's central nervous system with computers (and possibly with artificial intelligence)) such as regeneration of bodily tissues using stem cell cloning and use of prosthetic body parts (or body part extensions).

3. SUFFERING_MINIMIZATION: minimizing the degree to which any and all "Sufficiently Sentient Information Processing Agents" experience negative RESOURCE_OPTIMIZATION.

4. RESOURCE_OPTIMIZATION: maximizing the degree of benefit an information processing agent perceives itself as obtaining as a result of investing finite resources into some process intended to fulfill that information processing agent's goals; minimizing the degree to which an information processing agent perceives itself as wasting the finite resources which it invests towards its own goal-oriented endeavors.

5. TECHNOCRATIC_DIRECT_DEMOCRACY: a system of governance and implementation in the form of civilization-wide surveillance and information processing nodes of a mostly decentralized network which infers what each person's "real-time" knowledge and preferences are and which updates mass communication streams about "real-time" census data (which is a culmination of such preferences).
