While biking into the Lake Chabot Road entrance to Lake Chabot Regional Park this sunny and spring-like afternoon, I was thrown off my bicycle after one of its tires popped (despite being partially propped up by plastic tire liners between the air-filled rubber tubes and the outer rubber traction layer) while I was leaning into a left turn through the mostly vacant parking lot. Though I did lose some skin I felt almost no pain and, instead felt energized and ready to get up before the onlooking crowd of hikers and toll both attendants got a chance to gloat in my loss (and what I honestly suspect is intentional punishment (waged by XYZ) for not making my like revolve around violence or sex (instead of solitary hobbies and sustainable living). 

I locked my bike to a post for the time being in order to continue hiking into the wilderness northeast of Lake Chabot. (Before the (planned or unplanned) wipeout and tire flat occurred, my plan was to put my back back in the car which I am borrowing from my parents for safe and accessible keeping (and I thought it would be an opportune time to capitalize on that aforementioned spike in my energy level to do as many pull-ups in one set as I could at the pull-up bars which each have two metal hand rings hanging down from metal chains attached to a horizontal metal bar suspended between two wooden posts)). Then I went to the pull-up bars and busted out approximately ten in immediate succession. After that, I spun quickly clockwise and counterclockwise to stretch my spine, arms, and core ligaments gently. Then I walked up the hill near the Ranger Station (multiway hiking trail complex) to write this note on my phone. I remembered to bring my HP (Ubuntu) laptop with me today in my backpack (like I reminded myself to do in yesterday's note: x).

I will check now to see if my laptop is in usable condition after the fall we took earlier today.

(It was suggested to me that people (namely XYZ) wanted me to fall off my bicycle and have to pay money, time, and energy to get it repaired before I ride it again because those people are opposed to me showing off my freedom, happiness, and self-assurance (which might make the ladies and gents flock to me instead of to pissy pig heads like them) while they sulk in their gasoline powered tank throwns that they do not seem to have as much fun as a hippie elitist snob snowflake like me. To XYZ it is a grave sin to call attention to myself unless it is to serve The Establishment (which is a code word I assigned to implicitly refer primarily to patriarchal institutions which implicitly mandate the subordination of women to men (but which could just as easily be a campaign against atheists and other intellectuals who dare to think for themselves and share their knowledge with the larger world (instead of staying tightly sealed up and dumbed down so as to not threaten the fragile ego of the increasingly obsolete (to the workforce) XYZ)))).

I plan to get my bike repaired within the next two months. Perhaps I will get solid ("tubeless") tires installed (despite those things being significantly more expensive than standard inflatable tires. It is difficult to convince my parents to support me in ways which do not seem to appeal to XYZ, but almost always they seem hesitantly supportive of my lifestyle.

I was able to get my bicycle tire flat repaired for under $20 today at a local bicycle repair shop. Now my bicycle is ready to ride again and is currently being stowed in the back of the minivan I have been borrowing and which is parked near the house I am staying at (and where my Lenovo laptop has been stationed and hosting my .onion websites on the Tor network almost constantly for the past week).

Please disregard what I said about other people being uppity about my whereabouts and trying to sabotage me in any way. I honestly do not think I have very many real enemies. Instead, I think most of what I call XYZ is imaginary and the product of self-defensive paranoid thinking and that what I call The Establishment is also mostly fictional (because there seems to be no single all-encompassing governing agency where all of its human members share the same ideology and agenda).

(It could be that I said the previous paragraph as a means to illustrate what I might sound like when I attempt to avoid drama and, instead, just would rather come across as being very unassuming of other people's intentions in favor of assuming that more than 99% of all humans I ever meet are just like me in the sense that they simply want to be comfortable, avoid trouble, and do things which they think are useful and worthwhile (and not with the intent to hurt people)).

As of 11:50PM Pacific Standard Time on 22_JANUARY_2025, my HP (Ubuntu) laptop appears to have suffered no damage from the most recent bicycle accident I had.
