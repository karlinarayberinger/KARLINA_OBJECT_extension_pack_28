To Whom It May Concern:

I have whittled down the suspects (of people who deliberately cause me suffering to an obsessive and almost all-pervasive extent) to just anonymous people or strangers (to me) who work for the military-industrial complex as government employees or government appointed infiltrants (into my life and livelihood).

Whether what I now implicitly claim to assume is true (i.e. that only government agents are targeting me with ongoing psychotronic harassment) or else not true, I do think it is generally beneficial (for me and for anyone else I care about enough for me to intentionally avoid harming or inconveniencing (and ideally (according to the ethical philosophy I currently subscribe to) for every human and other of what I sometimes refer to as "sufficiently sentient information processing agents" (abbreviated as SSIPA)).

I substantiate the previous sentence by saying that, based on my own remembered personal experience, assuming that a cynical (and insufficiently proven (through amassing documented empirical evidence)) and damning "conspiracy theory" I have is generally not a problem people have to deal with provided that I pretend that I believe that there is no legitimate cause for concern (with respect to my "conspiracy theory").

To close this note, I would like to apologize to all those who I intentionally or unintentionally caused suffering to in the form of vandalism, physical violence, verbal abuse (including ad homimen attacks and making false (or unsubstantiated) claims that other people are committing crimes against me), economic loss, or any other form of non-trivial inconvenience or loss. I am definitely not an exemplary example for how to treat people with basic human decency based on what I think are arguably "unforgivable" crimes which I committed in the past.

Here's where "the rubber meets the road": my sensibilities for how society ought to deal with criminals (including violent or sex offending ones) are probably more Norwegian than American. In other words, I believe that rehabilitation rather than retribution should be the goal of incarceration and punishing criminals. I do not believe that torturing people to extract information from them (including false confessions) or to give the crime victim and those who sympathize with that victim sadistic gratification at deliberately trying to make the criminal suffer more than what is natural (but not excluding what I and the Norwegian criminal justice system seem to think is fair and necessary remedial action including prison, paying fines, and strict surveillance and supervision to the extent that is necessary for everyone's safety). I already apologized for my sins and I have already been making a valiant effort throughout the past five years to be on my best behavior. That does not mean that everyone is okay with me thriving as well as I think is ideal (and possible (especially without The Establishment's (mostly detrimental (to me)) interference)). 

I will do the best I can to always "make do" with what I have (and to devote the remainder of my lifespan to immersing myself in what I think are worthwhile pastimes and which pertain to deepening my appreciation of and understanding of the cosmos).

Sincerely,
karbytes
